These notebooks demonstrate (with simulation + plots) the rules and distributions from the provided formula sheet.

## Contents
- `00_rng_and_lln.ipynb` — RNG basics, seed, Law of Large Numbers
- `01_probability_rules.ipynb` — complements, unions/intersections, conditional probability, total probability, Bayes, independence
- `02_discrete_rv_moments.ipynb` — PMF/CDF, expectation + variance rules, Var(X+Y)=..., simulation checks
- `03_discrete_distributions.ipynb` — discrete uniform, Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric, Hypergeometric, Poisson
- `04_joint_cov_corr.ipynb` — covariance, correlation, linear transformations
- `05_continuous_uniform.ipynb` — continuous uniform PDF/CDF, percentiles/median, numerical integration
- `06_normal_clt_approximations.ipynb` — normal, standardization, Phi symmetry, CLT, binomial→normal approximation

## Requirements
- Python 3
- numpy, matplotlib, pandas
